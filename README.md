# Automated_Tasks
I automated several tasks to save time and effort.

Everything was done based on CentOS-7.


1- Docker and Docker-Compose installation on CentOS-7 

2- Kick-start server installation and configuration.

Notes for Kisckstart files: -

1- The server and the target machine must be on the same network.

2- In my case, kisckstart interface IP in 10.0.0.20, make sure you adjust this to your needs.
